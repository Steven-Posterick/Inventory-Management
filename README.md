How to setup: 
Create a database called InventoryManagement
Create an account on that database with an account
* Where Username=testuser and Password=testpassword
* Or Replace App.config ConnectionString with your own information and add it to your git.ignore to prevent uploading your credentials.

Finally run the setup.sql file inside the SQL folder.
